My modified version of the [underscores](http://underscores.me) starter WordPress theme. 

- The markup is simplified and classes are converted to BEM syntax.
- Sass with my defaults, and _s partials ready to be loaded (thanks to [sassy_s](https://github.com/sabreuse/sassy_s))
- Compass & susy for grids
